service to an AWS EKS cluster.

Requirements:

- Use Terraform to provision EKS, VPC, and ECR.

- Write a Dockerfile to containerize the Flask app.

- Create a Jenkins pipeline to build, test, and deploy the container.

- Write Kubernetes manifests to deploy the service on EKS.

Deliverables:

- Terraform files to provision AWS infrastructure.

- Dockerfile for Flask app.

- Jenkinsfile with full pipeline stages.

- Kubernetes deployment and service YAMLs.

- README with setup instructions.

Evaluation Criteria:

- Correctness and reproducibility of infrastructure.

- CI/CD automation completeness.

- Best practices in Kubernetes deployment.

- Security and modularity.
